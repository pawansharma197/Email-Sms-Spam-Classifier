# Email-Sms-Spam-Classifier

Email Spam Classifier is  a project which is used to classify whether the mail or sms is spam or not . 
For This Project Multinomial Naive bayes classifier is used . other Classification are also used but the best accuracy and precison which comes is on (MNB) Naive Bayes .

Accuracy is 97.59% and Precison : 1.00

 Email Spam-Filtering System
Mining text is one of the popular computation techniques widely applied in applications like text summarization, topic classification, machine translation, sentiment analysis, etc. Modern cybersecurity systems are utilizing machine learning methods a lot. Spam email detecting systems are one of them. Spam filtering also leverages text mining and document classification to segregate legitimate mails and spam emails. All modernized email services come with this segregation system that runs machine learning algorithms behind. Such a project comes under the text classification problems. Building this kind of a ML project involves the following important steps -

a.      Text Processing

b.      Text Sequencing

c.      Model Selection

d.      Implementation

Use libraries like Sklearn, NumPy, Counter, Scrubadub, Beautifier, Seaborn, and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. For training such machine learning models, a Spambase dataset can help you. Spambase dataset is an open-source UCI machine learning repository comprising around 5569 emails, of which nearly 745 are spam emails.
